# IRIS-FLOWER-PREDICTION


The objective of this project is to develop a web-based application that can predict the species of an Iris flower based on user-inputted measurements of its features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Using a trained machine learning model, the system will classify the flower into one of the three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, or Iris Virginica. The application will be built using the Flask framework to provide a user-friendly interface where users can input data and receive instant predictions.
